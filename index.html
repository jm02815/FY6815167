<h3 id="Abstract"><b>Abstract</b></h3>
Humans have always contemplated the meaning of life and the Universe. Mankind has always
asked questions that are even asked today. What is the purpose of life? How did Man 
originate? What is the Universe and how did it begin? and how will it end. 
The discipline which aims to unravel the origin and formation of the universe is known
as Cosmology. This short essay will illustrate early cosmology, how humankind conceived
the origin and formation of the Universe in prehistoric times, to the first historical
record, up until the time of Hellenistic Greece.

<h3 id="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
Planet Earth, some tens of thousands of years ago, inhabited by innumerable species all struggling for survival,
Carnivores hunting for food by preying on other animals. Herbivores surviving by dieting on vegetation. 
But one species an Omnivorous mammal who evolved into a two-legged creature in recent times when measured 
in relative to the chronological history of the cosmos and human evolution, descended from species who were 
the first to make stone tools. Their digestive system is naturally designed to diet on both plants and animals. 
These descendants of early hominid, by chance of evolutionary dice a rupture arose in their genetic being, 
impregnating their brains with millions of complex neurons, and eventually their brains gave birth to a quality 
that set them apart from the rest, Reason. 
    
The faculty Reason allowed them to create complex tools, do sophisticated artwork on cave walls, 
and form social organisation. they could now fashion variety of materials to create weapons to catch animals. 
The ability to organize into social groups meant they could create a community, giftedness of craftmanship 
meant more food and resources. This helped their population to increase in size and live together in communities.
The experiences and knowledges gained by an elder could now be passed on to the younger members of the group, 
thereby setting forth a tradition of knowledge, skills and mythology, each growing in complexity after successive
generations. 

 

<h3 id="Bronze Age- The First Urban Civilization"><b>Bronze Age- The First Urban Civilization</b></h3>
Over the passage of time, these species, homo sapiens, cultivated the soil and harvested agriculture, 
domesticated many animals to cater for their needs. Built homes, advancing greatly from their palaeolithic 
ancestors who took shelters inside a cave. The array of techniques, skills, instruments, and craftmanship 
inherited from the predecessors, improved each time from successive generations brought sophistication 
in daily life of mankind. 
    
In Around 3000 B.C in the valleys of the Tigris-Euphrates and the Nile, in the Middle East. 
The first Urban civilization arose, giving rise to the Sumerian civilization, and setting the beginning of 
the bronze age. The Sumerians achieved the peak of bronze metallurgy. They became aware that Copper could be 
obtained from certain mineral ores in a fire and could be melted and casts into various shapes The copper then 
could be alloyed with tin to give harder and more fusible metal, Bronze.<a href="#References">(1)</a>
    
In prehistoric times mankind were gathering around campfires. Hunting and gathering food and resources. 
Living simple and primitive life with no written record until the bronze age when recorded history began. 
When historical events, inherited and newly discovered knowledge, started to be imprinted on clay tablets, 
which were then baked for preservation.  As mankind evolved intellectually to the bronze age, it gave mankind 
an intellectual maturity to start asking questions about the heavens above them, the environment around them, 
and began to grasp the concept of the universe. They looked at the night sky, the dark expanse of glittering
stars, they travelled lands and oceans, and experienced the biodiversity around them and they started pondering,
what is the universe? How did it begin? What is mankind’s origin and how will it end. An early 
Cosmology- the understanding of the universe, took root.
    

<h3 id="The First Cosmology"><b>The First Cosmology</b></h3>
In 2000 BC the Babylonian started to depict the first Cosmology. They divided the sky into constellations. 
Created a catalogue of list of different stars and recorded the movement of different planets. They created 
sophisticated mathematics to study the patterns of stars in the sky, predicted eclipses and made calendars 
forecasting the seasons and dates of full and new Moon.<a href="#References">(2)</a>
    
The Bronze age societies around Eurasia, like the Babylonians speculated that the world was created by gods, 
that all of reality was in complete chaos and from this pre-existing chaos the gods brought them in order and 
harmony.<a href="#References">(3)</a> According to Indian Mythology ‘Brahma’ the Supreme Godhead brought the world into existence when he 
realised reality was in a chaotic state after waking up from a deep sleep. He realised that matter and substance
were disordered, disorganised and chaotic so he brought order by fashioning them thereby creating the World that
we experience today. Similar origin myth and prescientific cosmology existed in that epoch of human history. 
These cosmologies failed to explain the world, the celestial objects perceived with naked eye with naturalistic
explanations. Their conception of the Universe was very supernatural in nature and had no logical connections 
between causes and events, explanations about the origin and formation of the Universe was not scientific.

<h3 id="Ancient Greece"><b>Ancient Greece</b></h3>
In the Mediterranean, in the mainland of Greece, around 600 BC, there was a group of thinkers who called 
themselves Philosophers ‘the lovers of wisdom’ who concerned themselves about everything and tried to explain 
things rationally. They formed ideas about the origin and the nature of the Universe based on empiricism, 
mathematical analysis and became the first to form cosmology that were naturalistic and which would later 
influence thinkers and scientist right up to the early modern period.

The philosophers of Ancient Greece, who after going through many modes of reasoning, arrived at a stage where
they started making propositions which were naturalistic in explanations. Aristotle, who was a foremost among
them, proposed a Geocentric Model of the Universe where the Earth is at the centre of the Universe and 
everything else was orbiting around it. His conception of the Universe or Cosmology, along with Ptolemy, 
was so influential that the view was so vehemently upheld, especially in the medieval times by the 
Catholic Church. Anyone dare to oppose it was considered a downright heretic. Galileo was punished with 
death for opposing this view and declaring a Heliocentric Universe. The view continued right up until 
the early modern period, before the birth of modern science in the 19th Century.
